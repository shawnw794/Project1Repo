# Home Kitchen Pro application

If you're like me, you may have fallen into the rut of cooking the same ole same ole week after week. Maybe COVID brought you to the brink and has simply made cooking unenjoyable for you - or perhaps, COVID has done the opposite and channelled your inner chef so you're always looking for new recipes to put into your rotation? Whatever the case may be, allow us put some ideas together for you and present you with some thoughtful recipes. Some dishes may even come along with a wine pairing. What's more, to top it off, we'll provide you with some cocktail suggestions to help you get your party going. 

# Features

Our app features food and beverage recipes pulled from the Spoonacular and thecocktaildb.com APIs. The app itself is created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. 

Users are able to search by the kind of food, cuisine, or meal they are looking to create and they will be presented with a selection of three recipes with ingredients, pics of the meal, and a link to the recipe site for further instruction on how to construct it. Also, whenever we can, we will offer wine pairing suggestions. Lastly, we will provide a selection of 3 dinner party cocktails for you to consider to go along with your meal. 

We see incorporation of the cocktails as a key element because many "at home gourmonds" focus on the food. And while we think prepping and cooking a meal is great, why not step outside of your comfort zone and exercise your chops (no pun intended) with creating new and exciting beverages you may have never tried. Putting together a cocktail is not only fun, but it gives people something to enjoy before and/or after they've had their meal.
